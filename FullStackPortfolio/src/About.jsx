            <h2 className="Abouttext">FullStack Software Engineer</h2>
           <p className="Abouttext">Hi, you can call me Tam for short. I’m a passionate <strong>FullStack Software Engineer</strong> , currently working on my dream project, Harvey's Nine Lives, inspired by the pixel art games and franchises I cherished in my childhood, like Mario and Sonic. With expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies, I enjoy building dynamic web applications and interactive experiences.<br></br><br></br>
Before making the decision to transition into development, I gained valuable experience in B2B sales, where I <strong>booked and managed meetings with middle management to C-suite executives and founders across SMBs to enterprise level organizations.</strong> This background has honed my communication, problem-solving, and project management skills, which I now bring into my tech projects.<br></br><br></br>
Beyond development, I push myself through running, and <strong>I’m in my third consecutive year of running every day,</strong> tracking each run on Strava, and  <strong>losing over 40kg</strong> along the way. In my downtime, I enjoy watching anime and gaming, which greatly influence my creative work. Always eager to learn and tackle new challenges in both tech and game development!
